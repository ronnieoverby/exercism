# Leap

Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```plain
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does
this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Notes

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year
phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ecmascript.html

## Requirements

They are already described in the link above, but just as a
quick reference:

Install globally a tool to run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) if
it is not installed yet:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gulp test
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
